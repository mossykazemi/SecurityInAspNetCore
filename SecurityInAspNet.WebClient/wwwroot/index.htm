<h2>Victor Stuesse wins Lacie Award</h2>
<p>Victor Stuesse is the recipient of this year&rsquo;s Lacie Award, dedicated to honoring the work of a professor who has touched lives both inside and outside of the Roux community. As a teacher, Professor Stuesse has ushered over 900 students through the Craft + Design program, and has always been willing to share the secrets of his craft. As a sculptor and restorer, he has donated his time to public works projects such as the Central Park Arts Maintenance Council and the Metropolitan Museum&rsquo;s docent program.</p>
<p>Professor Stuesse has had a long and successful career in the arts, having received many commissions over the years in cities from Chicago to Bangkok, but always returns to &ldquo;the job I call a dream.&rdquo; For his dedication to teaching and community involvement, the Roux Academy is proud to award him with this year&rsquo;s prize, which also includes a stipend for pursuit of personal projects outside the academy. Congratulations, Professor Stuesse!</p>
